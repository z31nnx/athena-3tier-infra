# Trident AWS 3-Tier Infra
This project is a resilient, highly available, and secure 3-tier AWS architecture deployed manually and with **Terraform** (IaC). 

> **Renaming Notice â€” Sep 2025**
>
> This project was previously named **Athena**. It was renamed to **Trident** to avoid **service/resource naming collisions** (e.g., security groups, ALBs, ASGs, RDS identifiers).  
> Any screenshots or tags that still show `athena-*` refer to the same project prior to the rename.

# Overview 
This project demonstrates the deployment of a modern 3-tier architecture using both manual steps and Infrastructure as Code (IaC). It incorporates core AWS services to ensure scalability, availability, and security.
